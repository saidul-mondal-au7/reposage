### Runtime Flow

The application starts execution from the entry point app.py, which serves as the main application runner likely initializing and configuring the monolithic Python application. The src folder contains core application logic and modules such as app, data handling components, UI templates, and static assets. There are no evident external microservices or modular boundaries indicating networked service calls or complex service orchestration. The runtime flow involves loading data assets, rendering templates for the user interface, and handling user interaction in a cohesive single process.
